This program is used to test vpe (Video Processing Engine)
It is applicable for only dra7xx devices
================
Make sure you have loaded the vpe kernel module before this test is run
It would register a video device as /dev/videoX
Also, the vpdma firmware has to be loaded from userspace
===============
This test uses vpe through v4l2 apis for m2m framework

Example usage:
	./testvpe /dev/urandom 512 256 nv12 deinterlaced.yuv 512 512 1 1

This is an example to demonstrate how to use vpe through v4l2 m2m framework

For now, only deinterlacing is supported by vpe
